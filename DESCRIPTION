Description: 
    This package implements "Halfspace Mass" (a data depth) as well as a
    Monte Carlo-approximate halfspace (Tukey) depth. Therefore it provides a 
    train function that creates an arbitrary amount of Halfspaces from given 
    data and extends update, predict and autoplot generics by halfspace methods.
